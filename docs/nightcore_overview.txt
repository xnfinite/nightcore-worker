Night Core — Secure. Autonomous. Verified.

Night Core is a security framework that safely runs small programs called “modules”
inside sealed digital boxes known as sandboxes. These sandboxes make sure that
each program can only do what it’s allowed to do and can’t harm the system or
other programs running beside it.

Think of it like a virtual laboratory:
- Each tenant (user or project) gets its own clean, locked workspace.
- Before any code runs, Night Core checks the program’s identity and integrity.
  It does this using cryptographic signatures (Ed25519) — a mathematical way of
  proving the code hasn’t been tampered with.
- Every action is logged and verified for accountability.

Behind the scenes, Night Core uses:
- Rust, a memory-safe programming language.
- Wasmtime (WebAssembly runtime) to execute modules securely.
- WASI P1, a minimal operating system interface for WebAssembly.
- SHA-256 + Ed25519 cryptography to verify integrity and authorship.

Night Core is “multi-tenant,” meaning many independent modules can run safely
on the same system. Each module is verified, executed in isolation, and reported
in a simple HTML dashboard showing which tenants passed or failed verification.

In short:
Night Core is like a digital gatekeeper that ensures every piece of code is
authentic, isolated, and secure — a foundation for safe autonomous computing.

Core features:
- Signature verification (Ed25519 + SHA-256)
- Sandbox isolation (Wasmtime 37 + WASI P1)
- Automatic key synchronization
- Multi-tenant orchestration
- Real-time dashboard reports
- Secure upgrade and audit systems

Motto:
“Secure. Autonomous. Verified.”
