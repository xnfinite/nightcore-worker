# 🧠 Night Core AUFS — Autonomous Upgrade & Fork System
### Secure, Self-Healing, and Enterprise-Ready by Design

---

## 1. Overview

**Night Core AUFS (Autonomous Upgrade & Fork System)** is the self-healing layer that enables Night Core to **upgrade, fork, and verify itself automatically** — with cryptographic integrity and zero downtime.

It provides:
- **Instant Forks** for developers or enterprises.
- **Threshold-Signed Upgrades** for verified evolution.
- **Tamper-Evident Audit Chains** for provable compliance.
- **Schema Adapters** for WASI and manifest upgrades without breaking compatibility.
- **Self-Healing Automation** via AUFS core logic and Night Mesh pipelines.

AUFS transforms Night Core from a static runtime into a **living, self-validating orchestration system** — able to adapt safely across decades of runtime, ABI, and infrastructure changes.

## 2. Objectives

| Objective | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Durability** | Eliminate manual, error-prone upgrades and future-proof the runtime. |
| **Security** | Prevent tampering, unauthorized patches, or key misuse. |
| **Autonomy** | Enable Night Core to validate, upgrade, and recover itself. |
| **Portability** | Keep it independent of any single engine or cloud provider. |
| **Enterprise Assurance** | Provide provable logs, signatures, and audit trails for SOC2 / ISO27001-grade environments. |
