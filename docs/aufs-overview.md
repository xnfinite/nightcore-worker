<p align="center">
  <strong>Threshold-Signed • Self-Healing • Tamper-Evident</strong>
</p>

---

## 🌑 Overview
**AUFS (Autonomous Upgrade & Fork System)** enables Night Core™ to self-upgrade and fork securely.  
Each upgrade proposal is cryptographically signed by maintainers (2-of-3 threshold) and verified before execution.

---

## ⚙️ Architecture
- Threshold Ed25519 signatures  
- Manifest-based schema adapters for WASI upgrades  
- Reproducible builds for deterministic integrity  
- Hash-chained audit logs and transparency proofs  

---

## 🔁 Workflow
1. **Proposal** — Maintainers submit signed upgrade manifest (`upgrade_manifest.json`)  
2. **Verification** — Night Core™ validates all Ed25519 signatures and SHA-256 hashes  
3. **Execution** — Approved upgrade runs in isolated AUFS sandbox  
4. **Audit** — New baseline recorded in `foundation/baseline.json` and logged to `logs/audit.log`  

---

## 🛡️ Security Design
- Threshold-signed approvals (2-of-3)  
- SHA-256 manifest integrity checks  
- Immutable audit chain linking old and new baselines  
- Reversible rollback system for failed or tampered updates  

---

## 🎯 Purpose
AUFS ensures the Night Core™ framework can:  
- Evolve without central authority  
- Maintain enterprise-grade trust and auditability  
- Enable reproducible forks for verified downstream ecosystems
