##  Overview
The Night Core documentation describes every secure compute subsystem that powers the framework  from sandboxed execution to autonomous upgrades, distributed verification, and AI-assisted reasoning.

##  Core Architecture
| Component | Description | Link |
|------------|-------------|------|
| **Guardian** | Containment and security enforcement layer ensuring module integrity, fuel limits, and rollback control. | [docs/guardian.md](https://github.com/xnfinite/nightcore-worker/blob/main/docs/guardian.md) |
| **AUFS** | Autonomous Upgrade & Fork System  secure, threshold-signed update mechanism for reproducible, verified builds. | [docs/aufs-overview.md](https://github.com/xnfinite/nightcore-worker/blob/main/docs/aufs-overview.md) |
| **Night Mesh** | Distributed proof & audit synchronization across peer nodes  encrypted mesh verification and global integrity sharing. | [docs/nightmesh.md](https://github.com/xnfinite/nightcore-worker/blob/main/docs/nightmesh.md) |
| **Vesper** | AI assistant and self-documentation layer  enables reasoning, explanations, and autonomous debugging. | [docs/vesper.md](https://github.com/xnfinite/nightcore-worker/blob/main/docs/vesper.md) |
| **Governance** | Core security policies, threat modeling, and organizational baseline documentation. | [docs/security/GOVERNANCE.md](https://github.com/xnfinite/nightcore-worker/blob/main/docs/security/GOVERNANCE.md) |
| **Threat Model** | System-wide threat intelligence and mitigations against sandbox compromise, signature spoofing, and chain drift. | [docs/security/THREATMODEL.md](https://github.com/xnfinite/nightcore-worker/blob/main/docs/security/THREATMODEL.md) |
