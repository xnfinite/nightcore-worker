## 1. Origin — Why Night Core Was Built
Night Core was born from a single, clear frustration:  
modern compute infrastructure trusted too much, verified too little, and broke too easily.

As a developer working inside cloud environments, I saw how systems depended on central trust — administrators, pipelines, APIs — yet offered no cryptographic proof that workloads were actually secure.  
Night Core began as a personal experiment: *Could I make a system that refuses to run unverified code — even from myself?*

The answer became a framework.

Night Core was built to run software that protects itself — verified, logged, and isolated from manipulation.  
It’s not a product of bureaucracy or hype. It’s a rebellion against fragile trust.  
A commitment to digital integrity that never sleeps.

## 2. The Vision — Verified Autonomy
At its core, Night Core is a **self-verifying compute platform** powered by:

- Rust + Wasmtime 37 + WASI P1 — for sandboxed execution  
- Ed25519 + SHA-256 cryptography — for module signature verification and integrity checks  
- Multi-tenant orchestration — for isolated workloads that run side-by-side without interference  
- Fuel, memory, and time limits — for predictable, safe compute boundaries  
- HTML dashboard and JSONL audit logs — for tamper-evident observability  

Each module signs its own existence.  
Each tenant runs in its own world.  
Each action writes its truth to the ledger.  

That is verified autonomy — software that no longer requires blind faith in its operator.

## 3. The Mission — Problems Night Core Solved

| Problem | Legacy Systems | Night Core Solution |
|----------|----------------|--------------------|
| Unverified Execution | Code runs without proof of origin | Ed25519 + SHA-256 verification |
| Shared Trust Boundaries | Tenants share unguarded runtimes | Isolated WASM sandboxes per tenant |
| Unlogged Behavior | Actions vanish without trace | JSONL + HTML dashboard audit trail |
| Human Error & Tampering | Manual unverified changes | Autonomous signature verification + audit locks |
| Opaque Governance | Security based on policy | Cryptographic governance embedded in runtime |

Night Core turned “secure compute” from a document into an algorithm.  
It redefined trust as math, not management.

## 4. The Roadmap — Beyond v37
Night Core’s legacy is not static — it’s a living architecture designed to evolve through cryptographic governance.

### 🛰️ Night Mesh
Self-hosted communication and automation stack (GitHub Actions, Discord, Substack, Auto-Proof).

### 🔐 AUFS
Autonomous Upgrade & Fork System — threshold-signed, reproducible, tamper-evident upgrades.

### 🧠 Vesper
Night Core’s self-documenting Dev Agent — explains, verifies, reasons, and defends itself.

## 5. Legacy — A Foundation of Integrity
Night Core v37-B106 Stable is the verified baseline.  
Every module, signature, and log in this version represents the first complete, sealed cycle of verified autonomy.

This Chronicle is its cornerstone:  
> “Trust the proof, not the person.”

Night Core proves that autonomy and transparency can coexist.  
It is open for all, but it bows to none.
